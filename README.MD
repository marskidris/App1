# Animated2D Sprite Project

This project demonstrates a simple 2D sprite animation system in C#. Sprites can be positioned, sized, and animated by switching frames at set intervals.

## Features

- Display and animate 2D sprites
- Switch between different sprite frames and positions
- Easily configurable animation timing

## Requirements

- .NET 6.0 or later
- JetBrains Rider or Visual Studio

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Open the project:**
    - Open the folder in JetBrains Rider or Visual Studio.

3. **Build and run:**
    - Press `F5` or use the Run button to start the application.

## Usage

- The main sprite will animate between two frames every 1.5 seconds.
- You can modify the sprite's position and size in `Animated2D.cs` or `World.cs`.
- The animation cycles through frames 1, 2, and 3, then reverses (3 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 3 ...).

## Customization

- Change animation timing by editing the interval in `Animated2D.cs`.
- Adjust sprite positions and sizes as needed.
